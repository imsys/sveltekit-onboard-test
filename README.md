# sveltekit-onboard-test

This is a test of using [Sveltekit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) and [Onboard](https://github.com/blocknative/onboard)

## Developing

Installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
